# Text Editors

## “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE.

### What features should you look for in a text editor? 

I would say some of the most important features are: 

1.) Code completion.
2.) Syntax highlighting. 
3.) Variety of themes. 
4.) Extensions available when you need them. 

"basic" editors like notepad were not designed for web development and lack the functionality and 
efficiencies offered by coding-specific text editors.

IDE's offer all the tools you need in one place reducing configuration time and standardise working methods across an organisation. 
IDEs are complicated tools, maximizing their benefit will require time and patience.
